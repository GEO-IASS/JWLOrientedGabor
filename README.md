# JWLOrientedGabor
Simulation of an experiment by Marisa Carrasco and Jon Winawer measuring orientation discrimination thresholds of an acrhomatic, peripheral  Gabor .

The repository is initialized by copying all files in the ISETBIO repository HLColorOpponentGabor. The plan is to alter the code to reflect differences in the experiments, including acrhomatic orientation discrimination (this repository) versus chromatic discrimnation (HLColorOpponentGabor), and to include eye movement traces.
